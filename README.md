## 📌 Sentiment Analysis – Machine Learning Pipeline (Notebook-Based)

### 📖 Overview

This repository contains a **notebook-based machine learning pipeline** for sentiment analysis.
It focuses on **exploratory data analysis, text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation** using traditional NLP and machine learning techniques.

The notebooks are organized to reflect a clear, step-by-step workflow commonly followed in real-world ML projects.
